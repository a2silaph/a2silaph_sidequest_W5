Project/Assignment Decisions

Building off of example 5, I decided to create a camera experience that scrolls through a world larger than the screen through a “lonely night drive” concept. I did this through a car driving cruising slowly down a road in a nighttime setting. The car would pass by a night sky with clusters of stars, and different planets in the background. The car also had headlights to light up the road and streetlamps along the road to add for the luminous vibe. Also accompanied by roadside railing to finish off the nighttime drive vibe.
